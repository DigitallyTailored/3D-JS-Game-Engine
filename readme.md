A small JavaScript game engine I was working on in 2017.

It uses three.js which is tapping into browser OpenGL to do 3D rendering.

Works on Windows, Linux, Mac, Android and IOS.

Designed to run from a server but to test locally on Windows just run the start-server.bat file and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ in your browser. Supports WASD controls and touchscreen.

The engine itself is under src/helper. Everything else under src is game specific.
